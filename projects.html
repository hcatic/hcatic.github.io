                <strong>Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation - Go</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built and maintained key components of a distributed consensus algorithm using Go, ensuring fault tolerance and consistency across a cluster.</li>
                    <li>Executed core Raft functionalities including leader election, log replication, and heartbeats, increasing reliability and efficiency of state synchronization.</li>
                    <li>Designed and executed rigorous tests for election correctness, log matching, and safety properties to verify algorithm compliance with consensus specifications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Recipe Finder Application - Python</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Built a web app that helps users discover recipes based on input ingredients using the Spoonacular and Edamam APIs.</li>
                    <li>Implemented Google OAuth for secure login and integrated a scalable SQLite database for storing user recipes and ingredient lists.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced the user interface to provide a smooth experience for culinary exploration and reduced food waste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Connect Four Game - Python</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed a Connect Four game using object-oriented programming to be played against a human or AI player.</li>
                    <li>Created artificial intelligence “player” by implementing algorithms to assess future moves and counter moves.</li>
                    <li>Improved AI Player decision-making by integrating a recursive lookahead mechanism to simulate future moves and anticipate opponent counteraction.</li>
                </ul>
